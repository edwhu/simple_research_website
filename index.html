I am a CS Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I work on making robots do things from camera input, which requires a combination of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics.

Experience
===================================================

2020 - Present
: *Ph.D. Student*, University of Pennsylvania
: <br>Advisor: Professor Dinesh Jayaraman.
: <br>_Topic: Model-based Reinforcement Learning and Visuomotor Control_

: Creating machine learning methods that explicitly leverage the structure and priors of the physical world for robotic control.

2018 - 2020
: *Undergraduate Research Assistant*, University of Southern California
: <br> Advisor: Professor Joseph J. Lim
: <br>_Topic: Reinforcement and Imitation Learning for Robotics_

: _[Selective Imitation Learning](https://youngwoon.github.io/silo/)_: Robots that learn to imitate sensible portions of suboptimal demonstrations. Accepted to CoRL 2019.

Robot Magicians
===============================================================
Wouldn't it be cool to see a robot come up with a magic trick? To do so seemingly requires a deep understanding of physics, creativity, and sophisticated physical movements. But really, do we *need* those things? If we just solve those things, we probably have AGI already. Is there some simpler way? It's fun to think of how to make this a reality...
